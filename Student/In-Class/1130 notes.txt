an equivalence relation is one that is:
1. reflexive    a = a
2. symmmetric   a = b -> b = a
3. transitive   a = b and b = c -> a = c
It may be divided into equivalence partitions consisting of those values
related to each other. Equivalence partitions are disjoint since they 
have no elements in common.

Proof by induction only proves univeral generalizations, e.g. for all n, P n.

We have a base proof: P 0
and an inductive proof: for all n : Nat, P n -> P (n + 1)

induction axiom for natural numbers

For all (P : Nat -> Prop), P 0 -> For all n' : Nat, (P n' -> P (n' + 1))
-> for all n : Nat, P n

Can perform proofs of induction for other types like lists, start with [] as base case
